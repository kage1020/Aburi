# @aburi/framework-react

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f5cb552: Add `@aburi/framework-react`, a new framework plugin that classifies React
  sources into seven `framework:react:*` extKinds so React codebases (Vite / CRA
  / library authors — not just Next.js App Router) can be scanned by Aburi.

  Recognised shapes (first-match-wins in the order listed):

  - `framework:react:hook` — `/^use[A-Z]/` naming, with an extra `hook-call`
    `derivedBy` signal when the body calls another `use*` function
  - `framework:react:context` — `const X = createContext(...)` / `React.createContext(...)`
  - `framework:react:forward-ref` — `const X = forwardRef(...)` / `React.forwardRef(...)`
  - `framework:react:memo` — `const X = memo(...)` / `React.memo(...)`
  - `framework:react:provider` — PascalCase function whose returned JSX has
    `<X.Provider>` at its root
  - `framework:react:hoc` — `/^with[A-Z]/` naming
  - `framework:react:component` — PascalCase function whose body returns JSX
    (fallback)

  Detection is decorator-free: signals come from the symbol's name (leaf-of-qname
  regex), its `bodyNode` (tree-sitter walker looking for `jsx_element` /
  `jsx_self_closing_element` / `jsx_fragment`), and its `fullNode` (pre-order
  walk finding the outermost `call_expression` for the const-wrapper family). The
  plugin duck-types the tree-sitter node surface rather than depending on
  `web-tree-sitter` directly.

  `@aburi/lang-typescript`: extends `fileExtensions` and the internal
  `EXTENSION_GRAMMAR` map to accept `.js` / `.mjs` / `.cjs` (TypeScript grammar,
  permissively) and `.jsx` (tsx grammar, JSX-aware). This is what lets
  `@aburi/framework-react` classify React sources in plain-JavaScript codebases.

  `@aburi/cli`: `aburi init --with-suggestions` now maps a detected `react`
  framework to `@aburi/framework-react` alongside the existing `nestjs` /
  `nextjs` entries.

### Patch Changes

- b2f4382: Give `SymbolId`, `ComponentId`, and `SliceId` separate identities instead of three names for `string`.

  Aburi mints three kinds of identifier and each owns a namespace, but all three were the
  same type. `SymbolId` and `ComponentId` were bare aliases of `string`
  (`aburi.ir.v1.json#/$defs/*` are `{"type": "string"}`, and json-schema-to-typescript
  faithfully generates what the schema says); `SliceId` did not exist at all, so
  `SliceRecord.id` was `string` and `SliceRecord.members` was `string[]`. Nothing stopped a
  Component id being passed where a Symbol id was wanted, and `"slice:" + members[0]` — the
  Slice-id derivation — was an expression any file could open-code, because its result was
  assignable to the field it fed.

  `SymbolId` and `ComponentId` are now nominal types, `SliceId` exists and is nominal too,
  and `dependencies[].from` / `.to` are `SymbolId | ComponentId` rather than `string` — the
  union is honest about the one array that holds both kinds, while still refusing an
  arbitrary string. Every brand comes from a constructor: `makeSymbolId` / `trySymbolId` /
  `makeComponentId` in `@aburi/core` and `sliceIdFor` in `@aburi/diff`. Assertions
  (`x as SymbolId`) survive in four documented places and nowhere else — `packages/core/src/id.ts`,
  `sliceIdFor` plus the untyped-input predicate in `packages/diff/src/slice.ts`, the single
  `parsed as unknown as IR` in `readIR`, and per-package test fixtures, which need to be able
  to write a malformed id for the cases that exist to reject one.

  Two call sites were building Symbol ids by concatenation behind a type annotation and now
  go through the constructor: the call-graph resolver and the LSP enrichment pass, which
  assemble _speculative_ callee ids and test them for existence. Those use `trySymbolId`, the
  non-throwing variant — an id that cannot be built is a callee that cannot exist, which is
  the same answer as a well-formed id absent from the Symbol table, so resolution behaviour is
  unchanged. `@aburi/diff`'s git-rename stage, which rebuilds an id around a moved file path,
  goes through the same constructor for the same reason.

  The brands are TypeScript-only and erased at runtime. Scanning and diffing the
  `nestjs-billing` fixture produces byte-identical `ir.json`, `diff.json`, `workspace.md`, and
  `diff.md` before and after.

  ### Schema

  `aburi.ir.v1.json` and `aburi.diff.v1.json` gain three `$defs` — `DependencyEndpoint`,
  `SliceId`, and a loose `SymbolId` on the diff side — extracted verbatim from the inline
  subschemas they replace. The validation semantics are identical; the change exists so the
  generator has a named alias to attach a brand to. The brand itself is applied by a
  post-processing pass in `packages/types/scripts/codegen-lib.ts`, not by a `tsType`-style
  keyword in the schema: these are frozen v1 documents published for validators outside this
  repository, and a non-standard keyword would make every strict-mode validator reject the
  schema itself. That is the same reasoning that kept the Slice anchor keyword out of the file.

  ### Two new integrity invariants
  - **#16 — no reserved namespace.** Slice ids are `"slice:" + <anchor Symbol id>`, so a
    language plugin claiming the token `slice` would mint Symbol ids indistinguishable from
    Slice ids and make the derivation produce `slice:slice:…`. Branding cannot fix this — the
    strings are genuinely the same shape — so `makeSymbolId` rejects the token, and
    `checkIRIntegrity` rejects it in a Symbol id or a Dependency endpoint from a document it did
    not build. Only the whole token is reserved; `slicer` is still legal. `@aburi/diff` reports
    it as its own `SliceRecord` violation kind too, because `buildDiff` is public API and runs
    no integrity check. No plugin uses `slice` today.
  - **#17 — ids satisfy their own grammars.** `readIR` brands a whole parsed document with one
    `as unknown as IR`, which is the only way to type a JSON parse — so ids read from disk used
    to acquire their brand without anything looking at them, while every other route ran a
    constructor. #17 closes that: `symbols[].id` must satisfy `isSymbolId` and `components[].id`
    must satisfy `isComponentId`. It is also what catches a language plugin that asserts the
    brand instead of calling the constructor.

  ### Behaviour changes
  - **`ComponentId` accepts a digit-leading segment.** The pattern was
    `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` and is now `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, in both
    `aburi.ir.v1.json` and `aburi.config.v1.json`. Component ids are derived by kebab-casing a
    package or directory name, and `3d-force-graph` / `7zip-bin` are ordinary npm names — the
    letter-first rule made the documented derivation partial for no benefit. Loosening a pattern
    is additive: every document that validated before still does.
  - **Component detection fails loudly on a name that yields no id at all.** After the pattern
    change only one case remains — a name that kebab-cases to the empty string. It now raises
    `invalid-component-id` naming the package or directory it came from, instead of putting `""`
    in `components[].id` and producing an IR that fails its own schema somewhere else entirely.
    The CLI wraps it as a `config-error`, so it exits 2 (input) rather than 1 (runtime).
  - **A Symbol id file path may not contain `:` or `#`.** They are the id's own separators, so a
    path holding either assembles into a string that still matches the schema pattern but splits
    back into parts the producer never wrote. `makeSymbolId` now refuses them, which is what lets
    `isSymbolId` recover the parts and re-run the constructor's own check.

  ### Packages with no source change

  `@aburi/config` and `@aburi/plugin-registry` are bumped for the `ComponentId` pattern change
  in `aburi.config.v1.json` and for the `@aburi/types` dependency, respectively; neither has a
  source diff.

  ### For plugin authors

  `SymbolCandidate.id` and `OwnerSummary.id` are `SymbolId` rather than `string`. A language
  plugin that already builds ids with `makeSymbolId` — as `@aburi/lang-typescript` does —
  needs no change. One that concatenates the parts itself will stop type-checking and should
  switch to the constructor, which enforces the `ir-schema.md` §3.1 grammar it was assuming.
