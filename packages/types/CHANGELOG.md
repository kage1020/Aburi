## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 14bdb6b: Separate the `LanguageId` and `PluginRef` vocabularies

  `aburi.json` uses the key `languages` at two nesting levels with two different
  vocabularies: the top-level array holds plugin refs the loader resolves as module
  specifiers, while `components[].languages` holds `LanguageId`s constrained to
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$`. Both writers conflated them.

  - `LanguagePlugin` gains a required `languageId` field. `@aburi/core` projects it into
    `IR.workspace.languages`, which previously received `manifest.name` and therefore
    emitted `"lang-typescript"` — a value that fails the frozen `aburi.ir.v1` schema for
    every first-party plugin. Third-party language plugins must add the field.
  - `LanguageId` is now a branded type constructed through `makeLanguageId` (exported from
    `@aburi/core`), so a manifest name can no longer be assigned where a language id belongs.
  - `aburi init` writes plugin manifest names (`lang-typescript`, `framework-nestjs`) in the
    top-level arrays and keeps `LanguageId`s inside `components[]`. It previously wrote
    detector ids, so the loader looked for the non-existent `@aburi/ts` package and the
    documented `init` then `scan` quick start failed on every project.
  - `InitReport` gains `unmappedLanguages` / `unmappedFrameworks`, and the CLI warns about
    them. A detected language with no first-party plugin leaves `languages` empty, which is
    otherwise invisible until the next command stops.
  - `--with-suggestions` names the language plugin first, per `cli-spec.md` §4.6: it is a
    hard requirement for the next `aburi scan`, where a framework plugin only widens
    classification.
  - `aburi scan` refuses to run when no language plugin resolves, instead of writing an IR
    with zero Symbols and an empty `workspace.languages` at exit 0. That document fails the
    schema's `minItems: 1`, and two of them diff to `+0 -0 ~0` — so every `--fail-on` gate
    downstream passed regardless of what changed.
  - New integrity invariant #18: `workspace.languages` is non-empty, every entry satisfies
    the `LanguageId` grammar, and every `Symbol.language` appears in it. It also covers an IR
    read off disk, which `readIR` brands without validating.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b2f4382: Give `SymbolId`, `ComponentId`, and `SliceId` separate identities instead of three names for `string`.

  Aburi mints three kinds of identifier and each owns a namespace, but all three were the
  same type. `SymbolId` and `ComponentId` were bare aliases of `string`
  (`aburi.ir.v1.json#/$defs/*` are `{"type": "string"}`, and json-schema-to-typescript
  faithfully generates what the schema says); `SliceId` did not exist at all, so
  `SliceRecord.id` was `string` and `SliceRecord.members` was `string[]`. Nothing stopped a
  Component id being passed where a Symbol id was wanted, and `"slice:" + members[0]` — the
  Slice-id derivation — was an expression any file could open-code, because its result was
  assignable to the field it fed.

  `SymbolId` and `ComponentId` are now nominal types, `SliceId` exists and is nominal too,
  and `dependencies[].from` / `.to` are `SymbolId | ComponentId` rather than `string` — the
  union is honest about the one array that holds both kinds, while still refusing an
  arbitrary string. Every brand comes from a constructor: `makeSymbolId` / `trySymbolId` /
  `makeComponentId` in `@aburi/core` and `sliceIdFor` in `@aburi/diff`. Assertions
  (`x as SymbolId`) survive in four documented places and nowhere else — `packages/core/src/id.ts`,
  `sliceIdFor` plus the untyped-input predicate in `packages/diff/src/slice.ts`, the single
  `parsed as unknown as IR` in `readIR`, and per-package test fixtures, which need to be able
  to write a malformed id for the cases that exist to reject one.

  Two call sites were building Symbol ids by concatenation behind a type annotation and now
  go through the constructor: the call-graph resolver and the LSP enrichment pass, which
  assemble _speculative_ callee ids and test them for existence. Those use `trySymbolId`, the
  non-throwing variant — an id that cannot be built is a callee that cannot exist, which is
  the same answer as a well-formed id absent from the Symbol table, so resolution behaviour is
  unchanged. `@aburi/diff`'s git-rename stage, which rebuilds an id around a moved file path,
  goes through the same constructor for the same reason.

  The brands are TypeScript-only and erased at runtime. Scanning and diffing the
  `nestjs-billing` fixture produces byte-identical `ir.json`, `diff.json`, `workspace.md`, and
  `diff.md` before and after.

  ### Schema

  `aburi.ir.v1.json` and `aburi.diff.v1.json` gain three `$defs` — `DependencyEndpoint`,
  `SliceId`, and a loose `SymbolId` on the diff side — extracted verbatim from the inline
  subschemas they replace. The validation semantics are identical; the change exists so the
  generator has a named alias to attach a brand to. The brand itself is applied by a
  post-processing pass in `packages/types/scripts/codegen-lib.ts`, not by a `tsType`-style
  keyword in the schema: these are frozen v1 documents published for validators outside this
  repository, and a non-standard keyword would make every strict-mode validator reject the
  schema itself. That is the same reasoning that kept the Slice anchor keyword out of the file.

  ### Two new integrity invariants
  - **#16 — no reserved namespace.** Slice ids are `"slice:" + <anchor Symbol id>`, so a
    language plugin claiming the token `slice` would mint Symbol ids indistinguishable from
    Slice ids and make the derivation produce `slice:slice:…`. Branding cannot fix this — the
    strings are genuinely the same shape — so `makeSymbolId` rejects the token, and
    `checkIRIntegrity` rejects it in a Symbol id or a Dependency endpoint from a document it did
    not build. Only the whole token is reserved; `slicer` is still legal. `@aburi/diff` reports
    it as its own `SliceRecord` violation kind too, because `buildDiff` is public API and runs
    no integrity check. No plugin uses `slice` today.
  - **#17 — ids satisfy their own grammars.** `readIR` brands a whole parsed document with one
    `as unknown as IR`, which is the only way to type a JSON parse — so ids read from disk used
    to acquire their brand without anything looking at them, while every other route ran a
    constructor. #17 closes that: `symbols[].id` must satisfy `isSymbolId` and `components[].id`
    must satisfy `isComponentId`. It is also what catches a language plugin that asserts the
    brand instead of calling the constructor.

  ### Behaviour changes
  - **`ComponentId` accepts a digit-leading segment.** The pattern was
    `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` and is now `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, in both
    `aburi.ir.v1.json` and `aburi.config.v1.json`. Component ids are derived by kebab-casing a
    package or directory name, and `3d-force-graph` / `7zip-bin` are ordinary npm names — the
    letter-first rule made the documented derivation partial for no benefit. Loosening a pattern
    is additive: every document that validated before still does.
  - **Component detection fails loudly on a name that yields no id at all.** After the pattern
    change only one case remains — a name that kebab-cases to the empty string. It now raises
    `invalid-component-id` naming the package or directory it came from, instead of putting `""`
    in `components[].id` and producing an IR that fails its own schema somewhere else entirely.
    The CLI wraps it as a `config-error`, so it exits 2 (input) rather than 1 (runtime).
  - **A Symbol id file path may not contain `:` or `#`.** They are the id's own separators, so a
    path holding either assembles into a string that still matches the schema pattern but splits
    back into parts the producer never wrote. `makeSymbolId` now refuses them, which is what lets
    `isSymbolId` recover the parts and re-run the constructor's own check.

  ### Packages with no source change

  `@aburi/config` and `@aburi/plugin-registry` are bumped for the `ComponentId` pattern change
  in `aburi.config.v1.json` and for the `@aburi/types` dependency, respectively; neither has a
  source diff.

  ### For plugin authors

  `SymbolCandidate.id` and `OwnerSummary.id` are `SymbolId` rather than `string`. A language
  plugin that already builds ids with `makeSymbolId` — as `@aburi/lang-typescript` does —
  needs no change. One that concatenates the parts itself will stop type-checking and should
  switch to the constructor, which enforces the `ir-schema.md` §3.1 grammar it was assuming.

- df2f3ec: Report why calls stay unresolved instead of dropping them silently.

  `docs/design/slice-view.md` §5.4 gives calls with `resolved: null` no `CallEdge`,
  so a Controller → Service pair whose link the resolver could not identify shows
  up as two unrelated singleton Slices. The behaviour is intentional and unchanged
  — what was missing is any way for a reviewer to tell that apart from a genuinely
  disconnected change. This implements the diagnostic surface
  `docs/design/call-resolution.md` §8.1 had specified but left unbuilt, and with it
  the previously unsatisfiable test criteria CR27 / CR28 / CR29 of §10.4.

  `resolveCallGraph` now classifies every unresolved call into one of the five
  §8.1 buckets — `local-scope`, `external`, `dynamic`, `ambiguous`, `no-match` —
  using a fixed precedence so an unchanged workspace always reports the same
  numbers. Which calls resolve, the `CallEdge[]` they produce, and the resulting
  `slices[]` are all byte-identical to before.

  Surfaces:

  - `aburi scan` and `aburi diff` print one stdout line, e.g.
    `calls 1310 · resolved 1203 · unresolved 107 (external 30 · dynamic 60 · no-match 17)`.
    Zero-valued buckets are omitted. When the head IR predates the counter,
    `aburi diff` omits the line rather than printing misleading zeroes, and says so
    on stderr so the absence is not itself silent.
  - The `## 🧵 Slice View` section of `out/diff.md` gains a note when any member
    carries unresolved calls, plus a `⚠ N unresolved calls` marker on the affected
    members and singletons. Computed from the IR Symbols the diff already embeds —
    `aburi.diff.v1.json` is unchanged and `SliceRecord` gains no field.
  - `aburi explain <symbol> --debug-resolution` renders a `## Call resolution`
    table with the per-call bucket and, for `ambiguous`, the competing candidates.
    Per-call reasons are not persisted in the IR (§8.1), so the flag always
    rescans and is rejected alongside `--no-rescan` or `--ir`.

  No CI gate and no tuning knob was added: `--fail-on` is untouched, and
  `--debug-resolution` changes only what is printed
  (`docs/design/overview.md` §2, `slice-view.md` §14.7).

  Schema addition (non-breaking, additive per `ir-schema.md` §15.2): `Stats` grows
  an optional `callResolution` object holding `totalCalls`, `resolvedCalls`, and
  the five `unresolved` bucket counters. It is optional so documents produced
  before the field existed stay valid v1, but the current scan pipeline always
  emits it. New IR integrity invariant #15 re-derives all three numbers from
  `symbols[]`, so the census cannot drift from the document it describes.

  Public API additions:

  - `@aburi/types`: `CallResolutionStats` and `UnresolvedCallBuckets` (generated
    from the schema), plus the non-schema `UnresolvedCallBucket` /
    `UnresolvedCallDiagnostic` records. `CallCandidate` gains an optional
    `dynamicReceiver` flag — language plugins set it when the callee's receiver was
    an expression (`getRepo().save()`), which normalization otherwise collapses
    into something indistinguishable from a qualified name.
  - `@aburi/core`: `resolveCallGraph` returns `stats` and `diagnostics` alongside
    `symbols` / `edges`, accepts an optional `dynamicCallSites` input, and exports
    `makeCallSiteKey`. `ScanResult` gains `unresolvedCalls`.
  - `@aburi/markdown-projection`: `formatCallResolutionLine`, and an optional
    `unresolvedCalls` field on `ProjectSymbolExplainContext`. Explain output is
    byte-identical when it is omitted.
  - `@aburi/cli`: `DiffReport.callResolutionLine`, `ScanReport.callResolutionLine`
    / `ScanReport.unresolvedCalls`, and `ExplainOptions.debugResolution`.
  - `@aburi/lang-typescript`: reports `dynamicReceiver` for call, subscript, and
    parenthesized-expression receivers. Call target strings are unchanged, so no
    fingerprint moves.

- 2c5366d: Add `@aburi/framework-express`, a new framework plugin that classifies Express
  sources into five `framework:express:*` extKinds so Router-based apps and
  plain `app.get(...)` registrations can be scanned by Aburi.

  Recognised shapes (first-match-wins in the order listed):

  - `framework:express:router` — `const r = Router()` / `const r = express.Router()`
  - `framework:express:route` — `receiver.<method>(path, handler)` where `<method>`
    is one of `get` / `post` / `put` / `patch` / `delete` / `all`
  - `framework:express:middleware` — `.use(...)` with an arity-3 inline handler
    (or an identifier reference — flagged with `medium` confidence)
  - `framework:express:error-middleware` — `.use(...)` with an arity-4 handler
  - `framework:express:mount` — `.use(pathLiteral, identifier)` two-arg shape

  Confidence is `high` when the file imports `express` (ESM or CommonJS
  `require('express')`) and `medium` otherwise — the classification survives so
  the workspace projection still surfaces the shape, but consumers can treat
  medium-confidence rows as candidates for review.

  `@aburi/lang-typescript`: extends `extractSymbols` to promote module-level
  member-call expression statements (`app.get('/x', handler)`) into a new
  `kind: "call"` `SymbolCandidate` when the leaf method is in a small
  framework-registration whitelist. Symbol.id qnames are position-independent
  (`receiver__method[__pathSlug]__d<N>`) so IR fingerprints stay stable when
  leading imports or comments shift the source lines below.

  `@aburi/types`: adds `"call"` to the `SymbolKind` union and an optional
  `confidence?` field on `SymbolClassification` so framework plugins can express
  "matches the shape but I can't fully anchor it" (Express `.use(logger)` is
  `medium` unless the file imports `express`). Both fields are additive and
  optional — existing plugins (react / next / nestjs) remain unaffected.

  `@aburi/core`: the scan pipeline now threads `SymbolClassification.confidence`
  through to `Symbol.confidence`. When no framework classifier matches, or the
  winning classifier omits confidence, the value collapses to `"high"` at the
  `mergeFrameworkClassification` boundary so downstream code always sees a
  single, concrete `Confidence` encoding.

- 14bcd59: Settle what "no value" looks like in the IR, and make every writer say it the same way.

  `aburi.ir.v1` had two ways to spell an absent value and no rule for choosing between them. `SourceRange.startColumn` was written as an explicit `null`, `Signature.inferredThrows` had its key dropped entirely, and `Symbol.component` was never written at all — three conventions inside one document, none of them stated anywhere. Consumers absorbed the cost: `Symbol.component` and `Symbol.signature` each forced a `x === null || x === undefined` check at every read site, because a field that can be absent _and_ null has three states standing in for two meanings.

  Those checks stay. Writers are now consistent, but a document written before that cannot be rewritten, and `aburi diff` reads a committed IR as its base — so the reader half of the rule ("an absent Class A key reads as `null`") is what carries compatibility, and every `?? null` in the core, diff and projection packages is that rule's implementation rather than clutter to be cleaned up. A regression test now pins it: an IR with the keys stripped still validates, still passes the integrity check, and still diffs clean against one that has them.

  `ir-schema.md` §1.1 now fixes the rule, and the classification follows mechanically from the declared type rather than from anyone's judgement: a nullable optional is **Class A** — the writer always emits the key, carrying `null` when there is no value, and a reader treats an absent key as `null`. A non-nullable optional is **Class B** — the key's presence is itself the signal, so the writer omits it rather than substituting `[]`, `false`, or `null`. Every optional property in the schema now states its class in its `description`, which reaches plugin authors as JSDoc on the generated types, and a test fails on any future optional that lands without one.

  The writers that disagreed with the rule now follow it. `Symbol.component` and `Component.description` are emitted as explicit `null`, so a detected Component and a configured one have the same shape. Two output changes come with that, both in `@aburi/cli`: every Symbol gains `"component": null` and every Component gains `"description": null`, and a config-declared Component **loses** `publicApi` / `frameworks` when they are empty, where it previously wrote `[]`. Fingerprints, dependencies and stats are byte-identical either way. A config entry that omits `languages` now falls back to `["ts"]` as detection already did, instead of writing an `[]` that the IR schema rejects.

  `SymbolCandidate.source` is typed as the new `WrittenSourceRange`, which requires both column keys. A language plugin that builds a `SourceRange` without them no longer compiles. This is the one breaking change here, and it is deliberate: `serializeCanonical` drops `undefined` properties, so an omitted column is invisible in TypeScript and visible only in the emitted bytes. Plugins that already write `startColumn: null, endColumn: null` — as the in-tree TypeScript plugin does — need no change. The read-side `SourceRange` stays optional on purpose, because an IR loaded off disk may predate the rule and must remain representable.

- f56e21b: Add Slice View clustering to `aburi diff`. Changed Symbols are grouped into
  weakly-connected components over the union of base and head call edges
  (Union-Find WCC), and rendered in `out/diff.md` under a new `## 🧵 Slice View`
  section positioned between `## 🔧 Logic changes` and `## ➕ Added`. Each Slice
  appears as a `### slice:<smallest-member-id>` heading with the member count
  and one bullet per member (short qname, status label, `file:line`, and a `↳`
  delta-axis summary). Singleton Slices collapse into one `<details>` "Standalone
  changes" fold. Empty `slices[]` omits the Markdown section entirely.

  Schema addition (non-breaking, additive per `ir-schema.md` §15.2): the
  `aburi.diff.v1.json` output now carries an optional top-level `slices` array
  whose entries are `{ id: string; members: string[] }`. The array is always
  emitted (empty when no Node-eligible change exists).

  Public API additions:

  - `@aburi/core`: `computeWeaklyConnectedComponents<TNode>` (generic Union-Find
    WCC utility) and `reconstructCallEdgesFromIR` (rebuilds `CallEdge[]` from a
    scanned IR's `Symbol.calls[].resolved` fields).
  - `@aburi/diff`: `computeSlices` + `SliceInput` — pure clustering function
    consumed by `buildDiff`.
  - `@aburi/types`: `SliceRecord` re-exported from the package barrel.

  No CLI flag was added and no `--fail-on` selector was extended, per
  `docs/design/slice-view.md` §11.4 / §14.7. The `slices[]` output is deterministic,
  idempotent, input-order-insensitive, and local under the guarantees enumerated
  in §10 of the same document.

### Patch Changes

- c913783: Enforce the `SliceRecord.id` anchor derivation instead of trusting it.

  `docs/design/slice-view.md` §7.1 defines a Slice id as `"slice:" + members[0]`,
  but `aburi.diff.v1.json` only constrains it with `pattern: "^slice:"`. Neither
  the derivation nor the §8.2 ascending `members[]` order can be written in
  JSON Schema 2020-12 — both compare one property against another — so
  `{ id: "slice:foo", members: ["bar", "baz"] }` validated cleanly, and a reader
  that reconstructed the anchor from the id would name a Symbol the Slice does
  not contain. `computeSlices` also had no post-condition of its own: that
  `members[0]` is the lexicographically smallest member held only because
  `computeWeaklyConnectedComponents` sorts each component, one layer below the
  pass and invisible from it.

  The derivation now lives in exactly one function, and `computeSlices` validates
  every `SliceRecord` it builds before returning it — an empty `members[]`, a
  non-strictly-ascending `members[]`, or an `id` that is not `"slice:" +
members[0]` raises `DiffError` with the new code `slice-invariant-violated`.
  Emitted output is byte-identical to before; the check only fires on a producer
  bug. `docs/design/slice-view.md` gains §7.4 describing the three enforcement
  layers, §8.2 now states that the member order is strictly ascending and why,
  and §13.7 adds the test criteria SV23–SV25.

  Public API additions:

  - `@aburi/diff`: `sliceAnchor(record)` returns `members[0]` — the anchor — and
    never derives it from `id`, so no consumer has a reason to strip the `slice:`
    prefix. `sliceRecordViolation(value)` takes `unknown` and reports which
    clause broke as a `SliceRecordViolation` (`kind` / `subject` / `message`), so
    a validator can classify a verdict without parsing prose and cannot crash on
    the untyped documents it exists to reject.
    `assertSliceRecordInvariant(record)` is its throwing form.
  - `DiffErrorCode` grows `"slice-invariant-violated"` (code additions are
    non-breaking).
  - `@aburi/cli`: `classifyDiffError(error)` maps a `DiffError` onto the exit-code
    table. `slice-invariant-violated` now exits 1 as a `runtime-error` naming
    itself an Aburi bug, instead of exit 2 as a `config-error` that would send the
    reader searching `aburi.json` for a fault that is not there. Every other
    `DiffError` keeps its existing exit 2.

  `@aburi/core` documents the two output-ordering guarantees
  `computeWeaklyConnectedComponents` has always provided — each component sorted
  by ascending key, components sorted by their first element — since Slice View's
  anchor rule depends on the first of them. `@aburi/markdown-projection` replaces
  a `members[0] as string` cast with a real check; it still reads `members[0]`
  directly rather than importing `sliceAnchor`, keeping the renderer free of a
  dependency on the engine that produces what it renders.

  `schema/aburi.diff.v1.json` is unchanged apart from two `description` strings
  recording that `id` is derived and that consumers read `members[0]`; those flow
  into the generated `SliceRecord` doc comments in `@aburi/types`. No keyword was
  added to the schema file: v1 is frozen and published for validators outside
  this repository, and a non-standard keyword there would make every strict-mode
  validator reject the schema itself. The derivation check is instead registered
  as an Ajv keyword by the validating consumer — `packages/diff/test/schema.test.ts`
  layers it onto the shipped schema and rejects a wrong anchor the same way a
  wrong prefix is rejected.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 19f2494: Introduce the `@aburi/types` package. Auto-generates TypeScript declarations from the four public JSON Schemas (`aburi.ir.v1`, `aburi.config.v1`, `aburi.diff.v1`, `aburi.plugin.v1`) via `json-schema-to-typescript`, and adds hand-written contracts for `LanguagePlugin`, `EffectPlugin`, `FrameworkPlugin`, `VocabRegistry`, and the supporting `SymbolCandidate` / `CallCandidate` / `ParseResult` / `*Context` graph. Build artifact is `.d.mts` with an empty runtime stub. Regenerate with `pnpm --filter @aburi/types codegen`.
- 358f76f: Cut the initial `0.1.0` release of the Aburi ecosystem.

  This is the first public version of every workspace package that ships. The
  v0.1 scope defined in [`docs/roadmap.md`](https://github.com/kage1020/Aburi/blob/main/docs/roadmap.md)
  is complete:

  - **Foundation** — `@aburi/types` (schema-generated + hand-written interfaces),
    `@aburi/plugin-registry` (vocab registry + conflict enforcement),
    `@aburi/config` (JSONC + ajv-validated loader with framework-hint
    normalisation), `@aburi/core` (Symbol id, canonical JSON, 11 IR invariants,
    autodetect, scan orchestration).
  - **Language** — `@aburi/lang-typescript` (tree-sitter WASM TS/TSX plugin).
  - **Frameworks** — `@aburi/framework-nestjs`, `@aburi/framework-next`.
  - **Effects** — `@aburi/effects-prisma`, `@aburi/effects-nest`.
  - **Diff + projection** — `@aburi/diff` (5-stage semantic matcher +
    status + delta), `@aburi/markdown-projection` (workspace / component / diff
    / explain views).
  - **Delivery** — `@aburi/cli` (`aburi init | scan | diff | explain`, exit codes
    0 / 1 / 2 / 3, `--fail-on` gate), `@aburi/github-action` (composite action +
    marker-based PR comment upsert).

  ### Publishing pipeline
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — matrix (ubuntu / macos / windows) runs Biome
    `check`, `typecheck`, `build`, `test` on every PR and every push to `main`.
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml` — on push to `main`, `changesets/action@v1`
    either opens a "Version Packages" PR (when there are pending changesets) or,
    if that PR was already merged, runs `pnpm release` (typecheck + test + build
    - `changeset publish`) to push every bumped package to npm.
  - Authentication uses [**npm Trusted Publishing**](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers)
    (OIDC). No `NPM_TOKEN` secret is stored anywhere; pnpm 11.11.0 exchanges the
    workflow's OIDC token for a short-lived publish credential at publish time.
    Sigstore attestation is emitted via `provenance=true` in the workflow's
    `.npmrc`, and consumers verify tarballs with `npm audit signatures`.
  - `changesets/action` reads the `New tag: …` lines the publish command prints
    and creates a matching GitHub Release per per-package tag
    (`@aburi/<pkg>@0.1.0`).
  - Every public package.json carries `repository.directory` so npm links back
    to the correct monorepo subdirectory, plus explicit `author`, `homepage`,
    and `bugs` fields.

  ### One-time trusted-publisher setup (required before the first publish)

  For each of the 13 publishable `@aburi/*` packages, register a trusted
  publisher on npmjs.com pointing at this repository's release workflow:

  1. On the package settings page (e.g.
     `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aburi/cli/access` — for a not-yet-published
     package, first do a one-time manual `npm publish` to reserve the name, or
     configure the trusted publisher on the org account before publishing).
  2. Under "Trusted Publisher", add:
     - **Provider**: GitHub Actions
     - **Repository**: `kage1020/Aburi`
     - **Workflow filename**: `release.yml`
     - **Environment**: leave blank (no environment gating today)
  3. Repeat for all 13 packages, or configure the trusted publisher on the
     `@aburi` org so newly-scoped packages inherit it.

  Once configured, no rotation, no secret storage, and no static credential is
  ever created. Revoking access is a one-click delete on the npm settings page.

  ### Consumer entry points at 0.1.0
  - `npm i -D @aburi/cli @aburi/lang-typescript @aburi/framework-<yours>`
    (see the [root README](https://github.com/kage1020/Aburi#readme) for the
    quick start).
  - `uses: kage1020/Aburi/packages/github-action@main` in a workflow to gate
    PRs on the semantic diff. The action is referenced by repo path (composite
    action convention), and the CLI version it invokes is picked by the workflow
    author via the `version` input, so future CLI patch releases roll out to
    consumers without a fresh action tag. When per-release ref pinning is
    wanted, use the per-package tag `changesets/action` creates
    (`@aburi/github-action@0.1.0`) — an unscoped `v0.1.0` tag is intentionally
    not published because `changeset publish` names monorepo tags per package.

### Patch Changes

- a8882f0: Introduce the `@aburi/plugin-registry` package. Validates plugin manifests via ajv against `aburi.plugin.v1.json`, then registers their owned extKind / effect id / framework / derivedBy namespaces while enforcing reserved-namespace exclusivity (`core` / `aburi` / `_` / `framework:hint`), xPrefix derivation and consistency, type-namespace ownership, prefix-id shadowing, and prefix-prefix overlap in both directions. Surfaces `VocabRegistry`, `RegistryError`, `loadPluginManifest`, `parsePluginManifest`, and the `RESERVED_NAMESPACES` / `TYPE_NAMESPACE_RULES` constants.

  `@aburi/types` patch: `EffectVocab.description` and `ExtKindVocab.{baseKind, description}` are now nullable to model registry resolution through prefix ownership (`findEffect` / `findExtKind` return non-null for prefix-owned ids that the plugin did not enumerate individually).

- 405dcfa: Ship the v0.1 documentation set.

  - **Root `README.md`** — rewritten from a status placeholder into a full quick
    start: install / init / scan / diff / GitHub Action, a "why not just `git diff`"
    motivation with the four canonical scenarios, an architecture-at-a-glance
    block that walks source → IR → derived views, and a package matrix pointing
    at every workspace member.
  - **Per-package `README.md`** — 12 new files (`@aburi/types`,
    `@aburi/plugin-registry`, `@aburi/config`, `@aburi/core`,
    `@aburi/lang-typescript`, `@aburi/framework-nestjs`, `@aburi/framework-next`,
    `@aburi/effects-prisma`, `@aburi/effects-nest`, `@aburi/diff`,
    `@aburi/markdown-projection`, `@aburi/cli`). Each covers the pitch, install,
    the shape of the API the package exports, and design-doc references.
    `@aburi/github-action` already had one and is untouched.
  - **`docs/cli-reference.md`** — operator-facing per-subcommand reference for
    `aburi init / scan / diff / explain`: flags, `--fail-on` grammar, exit-code
    table, environment variables, config discovery order, and programmatic entry
    points.
  - **`docs/plugin-development.md`** — walkthrough for authoring `LanguagePlugin`
    / `FrameworkPlugin` / `EffectPlugin`, the manifest contract, the two-signal
    layered gate convention for effect classifiers, testing pattern, and CLI
    loader resolution rules.

  Docs-only change. Patch-bump every public package so the `files: ["dist", "src",
"README.md"]` package.json entry ships the freshly written README when the
  next release is cut.
